This little app takes some jokes from a server, and allows the user to view a new one every four seconds.

When a joke appears, the user can choose whether to categorize this joke as liked or disliked.

The user can change his choice at any time. Both when the joke is still the current joke, and when the displayed joke has moved on to the next one.

The app also adapts to the size of a mobile screen or tablet.

To create this small App the concepts of:

-Ng Modules
-Lazy Loading
-RxJS (Observables, pipe, BehaviourSubjects etc.)
-HttpClient

have been used.
